Absolute Position:

Elements with position: absolute are positioned relative to their nearest positioned ancestor or the initial containing block if no ancestor is positioned.

They are taken out of the normal document flow, meaning they do not affect the position of other elements.

Absolute positioning allows precise control over the element's position using the top, bottom, left, and right properties.

Relative Position:

Elements with position: relative are positioned relative to their normal position within the document flow.

They still occupy space in the normal flow, so other elements are not affected by their positioning.

Relative positioning allows shifting the element's position using the top, bottom, left, and right properties.

Fixed Position:

Elements with position: fixed are positioned relative to the viewport, meaning they remain fixed in the same position even when the page is scrolled.

They are removed from the normal flow and do not affect the position of other elements.

Fixed positioning is often used for creating elements that stick to a specific part of the screen, such as navigation menus or sticky headers.
