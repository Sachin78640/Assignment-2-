The Box Model is a fundamental concept in CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) that describes how elements are structured and how their content, padding, borders, and margins are organized within a rectangular box.

The CSS Box Model consists of the following components:

Content: The actual content or text of the element, such as text, images, or other HTML elements.

Padding: The space between the content and the element's border. It provides visual separation between the content and the border.

Border: The line or area that surrounds the element's content and padding. It can have a specified width, style, and color.

Margin: The space outside the element's border. It provides spacing between the element and other adjacent elements.
